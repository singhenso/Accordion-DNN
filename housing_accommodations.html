<h3>How to Obtain Services</h3>

<p>Registration with the Disability Services Office (DSO) within the Office of Student Experience is on a voluntary, self-identifying basis. Services are available only after a student has presented certified documentation of the disability from an appropriate medical or educational specialist, and this documentation has been reviewed and accepted as complete.</p>
